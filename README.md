# Titanik 
The Titanic is a well-known task at Kaggle, focused more on beginners in machine learning. The dataset Titanic contains passenger data for the ship. The goal of the problem is to build a model that can best predict whether an arbitrary passenger is alive or not.

## Setup:
  1) You will need to have `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
  2) The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this repo.

### That is all, I hope you enjoy!
